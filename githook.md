To create a pre-commit hook using Bash, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Bash script**: Write a Bash script that performs the checks you want to run before a commit. For example, if you want to check for the presence of "TODO" comments in the code, you could create a script like this:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   if git diff --cached | grep -q 'TODO'; then
       echo 'Your commit contains TODO comments. Resolve them before committing.'
       exit  1
   fi
   ```

   Save this script in your repository, for example as `pre-commit.sh`, and make sure it's executable (`chmod +x pre-commit.sh`).

2. **Create a `.git/hooks` directory**: If it doesn't exist already, create a `.git/hooks` directory in your repository. This is where Git will look for your hooks.

3. **Create a pre-commit hook**: In the `.git/hooks` directory, create a file called `pre-commit` (without any extension). This will be your pre-commit hook. Make it executable (`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`).

4. **Link the Bash script**: In the `pre-commit` hook file, add a line to call your Bash script. For example:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   ./.git/hooks/pre-commit.sh
   ```

   This will run your Bash script every time a commit is attempted.

5. **Share the repository**: When someone clones your repository, they will need to set up the hook manually by creating the `.git/hooks` directory and linking the `pre-commit` hook to your script.

6. **Automate hook installation**: To make it easier for others to set up the hook, you can provide a script that automates this process. Here's an example script you could include in your repository:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   cd .git/hooks
   if [ ! -f pre-commit ]; then
       cat << 'EOF' > pre-commit
   #!/bin/sh
   ./.git/hooks/pre-commit.sh
   EOF
       chmod +x pre-commit
   fi
   ```

   Save this script as `install-hooks.sh` and make it executable. Team members can run this script to automatically set up the pre-commit hook in their local repository [4].

Remember to commit and push the `pre-commit.sh` and `install-hooks.sh` scripts to your repository, so that they are available to others who clone your repository.


To automate the installation of pre-commit hooks for a Java application, you can use a combination of Git hooks and a build tool like Maven or Gradle to execute the hooks during the build process. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Create a Bash script for your pre-commit hook**: Write a Bash script that contains the checks or actions you want to perform before a commit. For example, you might want to check for code style or run tests.

2. **Place the script in your repository**: Add the script to your repository, and make sure it's executable.

3. **Configure the build tool**: If you're using Maven or Gradle, you can configure them to run the pre-commit hook as part of the build process. For Maven, you can use the `exec-maven-plugin` to execute the script. For Gradle, you can use the `Exec` task type.

4. **Update the build configuration file**: Modify your `pom.xml` (for Maven) or `build.gradle` (for Gradle) to include the execution of the pre-commit hook script.

5. **Commit and push the changes**: Commit the updated build configuration file and the pre-commit hook script to your repository.

6. **Educate your team**: Make sure your team members are aware of the changes and know how to run the build process, which will now include the pre-commit hook.

By following these steps, you're ensuring that the pre-commit hook is part of the build process. Whenever someone clones your repository and runs the build, the pre-commit hook will be executed, ensuring that the checks are performed without requiring additional setup.

Here's an example of how you might configure a Maven `pom.xml` to run a pre-commit hook:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
            <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>pre-commit-hook</id>
                    <phase>validate</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>exec</goal>
                    </goals>
                    <configuration>
                        <executable>./pre-commit.sh</executable>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

In this example, the `pre-commit.sh` script is executed during the `validate` phase of the Maven build. Adjust the `<executable>` path to point to your pre-commit hook script and the `<phase>` to the appropriate Maven phase [0][1].

For Gradle, you would add something like this to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
task runPreCommitHook(type: Exec) {
    commandLine './pre-commit.sh'
}

check.dependsOn runPreCommitHook
```

This will run the `pre-commit.sh` script before the `check` task, which is typically used to run tests [2].

By integrating the pre-commit hook into the build process, you ensure that it's automatically run for anyone who builds your application, without requiring them to manually set up Git hooks.
