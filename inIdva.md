##  Context-Aware Authentication with Behavioral Biometrics

Here's an idea for your banking sector innovation submission that focuses on authentication scope:

**Concept:** Implement a context-aware authentication system that utilizes behavioral biometrics to dynamically adjust the level of security required for different banking activities.

**How it Works:**

* The system analyzes various contextual factors like:
    * User location (familiar vs unfamiliar device/location)
    * Time of day (unusual access times might warrant stronger checks)
    * Transaction type (higher security for money transfers vs balance checks)
* Additionally, the system continuously monitors user behavior through:
    * Typing patterns (rhythm, pressure)
    * Swiping patterns (speed, direction)
    *  Mouse movements (fluidity, accuracy)
* Based on the context and real-time behavioral analysis, the system determines the appropriate level of authentication:
    * Low-risk actions (checking balance) might require only a simple PIN or fingerprint scan.
    * High-risk actions (large money transfers) might require a combination of factors like multi-factor authentication (MFA) with a one-time code and verification of behavioral biometrics.

**Benefits:**

* **Enhanced Security:** Dynamic authentication based on context and behavior makes it harder for unauthorized access as it adapts to potential threats.
* **Improved User Experience:** Faster and smoother logins for routine tasks with lower risk. Users only go through stronger authentication when absolutely necessary.
* **Reduced Fraud:**  The system can detect anomalies in user behavior that might indicate fraudulent activity, leading to faster intervention.

**Implementation and Feasibility:**

* Leverage existing user data and combine it with machine learning algorithms to analyze behavior patterns and establish baselines.
* Integrate the system with current banking infrastructure for a seamless user experience.
* Partner with established behavioral biometrics companies for expertise and existing solutions.

**Scalability and Future-proofing:**

* The system is designed to continuously learn and adapt to evolving user behavior and potential security threats.
* As new technologies emerge, the system can be easily integrated with more sophisticated behavioral biometric solutions. 

This is just a starting point, and you can further customize it by:

* Specifying the type of behavioral biometrics you'd focus on (e.g., voice recognition, facial recognition).
* Proposing additional contextual factors the system could consider (e.g., device type, network information).

By presenting a well-defined and user-centric solution like this, you can make a strong case for your innovation in the banking sector.
